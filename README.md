# ANN-Based Forward Modeling

## This is the companion MATLAB code of the paper by Moghadas JAG 2020 (see reference below). 

This code contains the following scripts: 

MK_ANN_Data: program to read training models and split data for ANN training.

ANN_Training: program to to train ANN to create proxy forward modeling.

Simulation: program to calculate EMI forward response from ANN-based forward model
